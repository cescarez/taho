          <li>She can be shy/aloof with new people. After a few walks and a few meals, she warms up.</li>
          <li>Because of the aformentioned shyness, she may be stubborn about going places on walks or getting in the car.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Feel free to use <span class="important">lots</span> of treats to bribe her into listening to you. Also pieces of food work great as treats right now because she loves her food -- just please reduce her next meal portion accordingly if you feed her a bunch of treats between mealtimes.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>She does <em>not</em> like the dog park.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Once I lost her because she ran away from me to sit by the car.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>She is afraid of medium to large high-energy dogs.</li>
          <li>Her recall (return rate when called) is pretty low. We're working on it, but she's definitely got stray-mentality when given complete freedom.</li>
